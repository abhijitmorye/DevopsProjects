Syslog
The Syslog log driver will write all the container logs to the central syslog on the host. "syslog is a widely used standard for message logging. It permits separation of the software that generates messages, the system that stores them, and the software that reports and analyses them." Wikipedia

This log-driver is designed to be used when syslog is being collected and aggregated by an external system.

Example
The command below will redirect the redis logs to syslog.

                docker run -d --name redis-syslog --log-driver=syslog redis

Accessing Logs
If you attempted to view the logs using the client you'll recieve the error FATA[0000] "logs" command is supported only for "json-file" logging driver

Instead, you need to access them via the syslog stream.


The third option is to disable logging on the container. This is particularly useful for containers which are very verbose in their logging.

Example
When the container is launched simply set the log-driver to none. No output will be logged.

                docker run -d --name redis-none --log-driver=none redis
